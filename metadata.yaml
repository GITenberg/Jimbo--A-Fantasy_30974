description: A seven-year-old boy suffers a near-fatal injury, after which he lingers
  for days between life and death. In this liminal period, the young protagonist undergoes
  a bizarre experience wherein he feels as if he has become untethered from his physical
  body. Filled with both hopeful wonderment and bursts of sheer, unadulterated terror,
  Jimbo is a strange and satisfying read that will stick with you long after you've
  finished it.
